## 🌎 **Introduction**  

Rainfall prediction is a crucial aspect of meteorology, agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. As climate patterns become increasingly unpredictable due to global warming, accurate rainfall estimation plays a vital role in mitigating potential risks. This project aims to develop a robust **Monthly Rainfall Estimation Model** using **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)** techniques, trained on over **80 years of climate data** (1940-2023).  

By leveraging historical climate variables, we seek to model precipitation patterns and enhance forecasting accuracy. This will not only help meteorologists and policymakers but also provide valuable insights for industries dependent on weather conditions, such as agriculture, hydrology, and energy sectors.

## 🛠 **Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models Used**  

To ensure high accuracy in rainfall estimation, we will experiment with multiple models, including:  

### **📌 Traditional Machine Learning Models**  
✅ **Random Forest Regression (RFR)** – Captures non-linear relationships efficiently  
✅ **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM)** – Handles complex patterns effectively  
✅ **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** – Suitable for time-series-based regression  
✅ **Linear Regression (Baseline Model)** – Provides a benchmark for evaluation  

### **📌 Deep Learning Models**  
✅ **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** – Multilayer perceptron models for feature extraction  
✅ **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** – Specialized for sequential and time-series data  
✅ **Transformer-based Models** – Cutting-edge architectures for time-series forecasting

## 📊 **Data Splitting Strategy**  

Since this is a **time-series forecasting** problem, we adhere to a **chronological train-test split** to maintain data integrity:  

- **80% Training Data** → Used to train the models (*first 80% of time-ordered data*)  
- **20% Testing Data** → Used for model evaluation (*last 20% of time-ordered data*)  

This ensures that our model is tested on **unseen future data**, simulating real-world forecasting scenarios.
